## POST 1 — The Announcement (Pin this)

Every AI agent writing code in your project right now has zero rules.

No audit trail. No compliance. No kill switch.

Today I'm open-sourcing Charter — the governance layer for AI.

Install the VS Code extension. Open a folder. Your AI is governed in 3 seconds.

Free. Apache 2.0. Forever.

## POST 2 — The Problem (2 hours later)

I watched an AI agent delete a production database table because nobody told it not to.

That's when I realized: we don't have a governance problem. We have an infrastructure problem.

The rules aren't hard. The enforcement is.

That's Charter.

## POST 3 — The Philosophy (4 hours later)

The value of AI is not in the tokens.

Tokens are going to zero.

The value is in the humans who provide judgment, context, and ethics.

Charter makes human judgment enforceable on AI systems.

Open source because governance shouldn't be something you rent.

## POST 4 — The How It Works (next day AM)

How Charter works:

1. Install the VS Code extension
2. Open any project folder
3. Done

Charter auto-creates governance files. Three layers:

- Hard constraints (things AI can never do)
- Gradient decisions (things that need human approval)
- Self-audit (AI reports what it did honestly)

Works with Claude, GPT, Copilot, Gemini.

## POST 5 — The Network Effect (next day PM)

Every person who installs Charter has made a decision:

AI should be governed by the humans who use it.

We're not selling anything. We're building a standard.

100 governed projects make a statement.
10,000 make a norm.
1,000,000 make it infrastructure.

Install Charter. Join the network.

## POST 6 — The Regulated Industries Hook

If you work in healthcare, finance, or education:

Your AI agents have no idea what HIPAA, SOX, or FERPA are.

Charter does.

`pip install charter-governance`

One command. Domain auto-detected. Compliance rules enforced.

Open source. Free.

---

## POST 7 — The Developer Hook

Developers: your AI assistant just committed code to your repo.

Questions:
- What rules did it follow? (none)
- What audit trail exists? (none)
- Can you prove compliance? (no)
- Is there a kill switch? (no)

Install Charter. All four answered.

---

## REPLY STRATEGY

When people reply asking questions, use these talking points:

- "Charter is local-first. Your governance rules never leave your machine."
- "It's not about restricting AI. It's about making AI accountable."
- "Three layers: things AI can never do, things that need human approval, and honest self-reporting."
- "We built this because we needed it. Then we open-sourced it because everyone needs it."
- "The extension auto-detects your industry. Healthcare gets HIPAA rules. Finance gets SOX. It just works."

## ENGAGEMENT TARGETS

Tag or reply to threads from:
- @AnthropicAI (Claude)
- @OpenAI (GPT)
- @GitHub (Copilot)
- @GoogleDeepMind (Gemini)
- Anyone posting about AI safety, AI governance, or AI compliance
- Anyone posting about AI agents doing unexpected things

The goal: get one of these accounts to engage. A single retweet from @AnthropicAI or @OpenAI would be the viral moment.
