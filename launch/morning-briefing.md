# Charter Launch — Morning Briefing

## What Happened

Charter is now live on the VS Code Marketplace.

Anyone can install it right now by searching "Charter" or "AI Governance" in VS Code Extensions.

## What Is Charter

Charter is an AI governance layer. When you install the extension and open a project folder, it automatically creates governance rules that every AI agent in that workspace must follow.

Three layers:
- **Hard constraints** — things the AI can never do (fabricate data, delete without confirmation, send external comms without approval)
- **Gradient decisions** — actions that require human judgment above certain thresholds
- **Self-audit** — the AI reviews its own work and reports honestly

It works with Claude, GPT, Copilot, Gemini — any AI tool.

## Why This Matters

Every developer using AI agents today is working without governance. There's no audit trail. No compliance. No kill switch. Charter is the first open-source tool that makes human judgment enforceable on AI systems.

This is infrastructure, not a product. Apache 2.0. Free forever.

## What We Need From the Team

1. **Install the extension** — Search "Charter" in VS Code Extensions. Takes 10 seconds.
2. **Leave a review** — A 5-star review with one sentence about why governance matters. Early reviews directly affect search ranking.
3. **Share it** — Forward this briefing. Post about it. Tell anyone who uses AI tools to write code.
4. **Open a governed project** — Open any folder with the extension installed. See the green "GOVERNED" badge appear. That's it working.

## The Bigger Picture

We are building a network. Every person who installs Charter has agreed that AI should be governed by the humans who use it. The more people who install it, the stronger the standard becomes. We are creating the governance layer for the AI era — and it starts with our team installing it today.
